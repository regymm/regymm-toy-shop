  The add-on that brings openwifi to PYNQ-Z1 
description_markdown_full: |
  <br/>
  The original idea from late 2021, now ready for sale. Even with a new 299$ PYNQ-Z1, this combo is still the cheapest available openwifi-capable platform(as of late 2022). <br/>
  Functions: PlutoSDR firmware, iio-oscilloscope, GQRX, dump1090, GNURadio, openwifi firmware, WiFi hotspot, packets capture, connect to other hotspots, and more. <br/>
  Limitations: Due to bandwidth limitations of the TX LVDS connections, 1RX1TX 40 MHz sample rate is the maximum. This is enough for all openwifi operations. For RX, 61.44 MHz sample rate can be possible. The baluns are not rated for 5 GHz, so transmission power is low. Also, I don't guarentee any exotic RF performance except that on my desk an iPhone can connect and communicate with the openwifi hotspot 20 cm away from the antennae.<br/>
  Items included: PYNQSDR HAT itself, HDMI cable x2, PMOD bridge x2, Antenna x2, SMA adapter x2. See picture below. <i>PYNQ-Z1 itself is NOT included!</i><br/>
  Connection: The 3 SMA connectors(2 used, one spare) on HAT are SMA-P(ordinary standard), the adapters are SMA-J to RP-SMA-P, the antennae are RP-SMA-J(WiFi standard). See picture below. <br/>
  Setup guide and software support(including pre-built ready-to-use SD card images) will come later, before you receive the board if lucky. <br/>
