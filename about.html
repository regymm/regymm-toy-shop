			<h3 class="editable">Fun</h3>
			<p class="editable">Selling self-designed hardware worldwide is one of coolest things I can imagine. And with cost recovered I can roll out new boards quicker :) </p>

	<h3>Things you should know before...</h3>
	<i>TLDR: You should take basic cautions when interacting with a random folk on the Internet. </i>
	<p>- Refurbished/Scavenged/Unknown-source-d chips are used in order to provide such a cheap price. Though I'll certainly test everything and have never seen a good chip going bad so far(only ones that come as bad), reliability won't be as good as other well-designed products. So don't have too high an expectation -- it's more a handcraft than mass-production. </p>
	<p>- All board contains lead(Pb), so at least wash your hand after touching solder joints, and dispose according to local regulations. </p>
	<p>- Details of the product may not be well controlled, including but not limited to how many components are soldered on board(as long as guaranteed functionality), shape and color of board, types of the small bridge boards, and some manually soldered components(my PCB files are too crappy to be properly SMT-ed). But I'll send a picture of what will be shipped. </p>
	<h4 style="color:#666">To people of interest in China</h4>
	<p>Letting the product shipped from China then back just isn't cost-effective(and probably makes it less competitive than other available alternatives), You can of course purchase now and pay in whatever way you want, but later if I can somehow do testings in China, there could potentially be a decent discount. </p>
	<h4 style="color:#666">To people of interest in Japan</h4>
	<p>More payment options might be available, which may have a mild discount. </p>
